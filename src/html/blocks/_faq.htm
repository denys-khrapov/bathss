								<p>Unlike conventional saunas and steam rooms that you may have been to, a traditional Banya takes
									things further for a feeling of euphoric refreshment, rather than zen stillness. Inside the Banya,
									a tonne of cast iron is heated to 700oC inside an authentic brick furnace - generating superheated
									steam the second water touches it. When contrasted with the crisp cascade of an icy cold bucket
									shower or plunge pool dip, the result is a level of thermal exhilaration and vitality like no
									other.</p>
								<p>But the full Banya Spa treatment goes way beyond that.</p>
								<p>From deep tissue massage (made more effective when the muscles have been warmed in the Parenie)
									to Honey & Salt or Coffee scrubs, from full Face & Décolleté mud masks to delicious traditional
									food and drinks- The Banya no.1 - Hoxton experience is a feast for all five senses. This makes it
									perfect for special occasions and regular visits alike.</p>

						<div class="accordion__content ">
							<div class="accordion__text-holder paragraph">
								<p>Visiting a Banya spa can provide a huge range of health benefits that can make a major positive
									impact on your mental and physical wellbeing. The intense heat helps raise your heart rate,
									promoting blood circulation, while the brisk cooling slows the heart down again, strengthening
									your cardiovascular system. Traditional Russian Spa experiences have also been linked to helping
									with weight loss, alleviating respiratory problems, strengthening the immune system, reducing
									muscle pain and inflammation, even building resilience to stress.</p>

								<p>When you visit Banya no.1 - Hoxton our friendly, experienced Banya professionals will be able to
									guide you through every step of the way. But ahead of your visit, be aware that swimming attire is
									only compulsory on mixed gender days - optional on men-only and women-only days. On women-only
									days, we recommend a two-piece swimsuit rather than a one-piece, as it makes the treatment process
									easier. In public areas and flip flops are compulsory everywhere.</p>

								<p>Your treatment will typically consist of first a session in the hot Parenie steam chamber,
									followed by a cold plunge pool. Then rest, rinse, repeat. If you are interested in any of our
									specialist treatments, you can learn about them all.</p>
